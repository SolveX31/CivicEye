**Crowdsourced Civic Issue Reporting & Resolution System**
**CivicEye: An Eye On Civic Issues**

**Introduction**
Citizens often struggle with reporting civic problems, leading to unresolved issues and a breakdown in communication with local authorities. CivicEye is a platform designed to solve this. Our system allows citizens to easily report civic issues—such as potholes or overflowing bins—using photos and location data. These reports are made visible on a map for the entire community. By crowdsourcing and leveraging technology, we create a transparent and efficient way to bridge the gap between citizens and government staff.

**Key Features**
_Easy Complaint Submission_: Citizens can report issues with a photo and location anytime, anywhere.
_Faster Resolution_: Issues are sent directly to the relevant authorities, speeding up the resolution process.
_Transparent Updates_: Citizens are kept informed and can track the progress of their reported issues.
_Secure & Reliable_: The platform uses Aadhaar/DigiLocker for secure authentication, ensuring reliable login.
_Crowd Validation + AI Filters_: Reports are validated through community upvotes, image analysis, and duplicate detection to reduce fake complaints.
_Offline / SMS Reporting_: The system is designed to handle submissions even in areas with low internet connectivity.
_Data-Driven Insights_: The collected data provides valuable analytics that help the government with better urban planning.

**How to Use CivicEye**
_Locate & Send_: A user spots a civic issue and reports it using the mobile app, which captures the location and allows for a photo upload.
_Verify_: The report appears on a public map, and other citizens can vote or comment to verify the issue.
_Resolve_: Government staff view and manage reports through an admin dashboard, then resolve the issues.
Track & Update: The user receives real-time updates and can track the progress of their reported issue until it is marked as resolved.

**Technical Stack**
_Frontend_: The application and website are built using React and Flutter.
_Backend_: The backend is powered by Node.js and Django.
_Database_: We use PostgreSQL.

**APIs & Services:**
_Mapping_: Google Maps Developers APIs for geolocation.
_Notifications_: SendGrid/Twilio for email and SMS alerts.
_Authentication_: DigiLocker API for secure login.

**Conclusion**
CivicEye is more than just a reporting tool; it's a step towards building smarter, cleaner, and more accountable cities. By empowering citizens to become active participants in governance, we can create a more transparent and responsive system for resolving civic issues. This project demonstrates how technology can be leveraged to foster community engagement and create a better living environment for everyone.
